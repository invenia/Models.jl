A wide variety of these are available as open-source packages ... Using generic packages often results in a glue-code system design pattern, in which a massive amount of supporting code is written to get data into and out of general-purpose packages. Glue-code is costly in the long term because it tends to freeze a system to the peculiarities of a specific package; testing alternatives may become prohibitively expensive.... An important strategy for combating glue-code is to wrap black-box packages into common API’s. This allows supporting infrastructure to be more reusable and reduces the cost of changing packages.","category":"page"},{"location":"design.html#","page":"Design","title":"Design","text":"– Sculley et al 2015","category":"page"},{"location":"design.html#","page":"Design","title":"Design","text":"Models.jl provides a common API for mostly preexisting models to allow them to all be used in the same way.
